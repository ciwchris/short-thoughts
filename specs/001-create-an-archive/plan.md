# Implementation Plan: Archive Page

**Branch**: `001-create-an-archive` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-an-archive/spec.md`

## Summary
Create an archive page at `/archive` that displays all blog posts grouped by year in reverse chronological order. A link to the archive page will be at the bottom of every page, but it will not be displayed if there are no blog posts.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Astro
**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: Markdown files
**Testing**: N/A
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: single project
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Principle 1: Technology Stack:** The project uses Astro and Tailwind CSS. No other libraries or frameworks should be introduced. - **PASS**
- **Principle 2: Content Management:** All blog content is created and managed as Markdown files in the `src/content/blog` directory. - **PASS**
- **Principle 3: Styling:** All styling must be done using Tailwind CSS. Global styles are defined in `src/styles/global.css`, but should be used sparingly. - **PASS**

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)
```
specs/001-create-an-archive/
├── plan.md              # This file (/plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/tasks command - NOT created by /plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)
```
src/
└── pages/
    └── archive.astro
```

**Structure Decision**: A new page will be created at `src/pages/archive.astro`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
No research is needed for this feature.

**Output**: research.md

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

- **`data-model.md`:** The data model is already defined by the existing blog posts.
- **`quickstart.md`:** A quickstart guide will be created to describe how to test the feature.

**Output**: data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create a new page at `src/pages/archive.astro`.
- Fetch all blog posts using `getCollection('blog')`.
- Group the posts by year.
- Render the posts in a list, grouped by year in reverse chronological order.
- Ensure each blog post title links to the correct blog post page.
- Add a link to the archive page in the footer of the main layout.
- The link should only be displayed if there are blog posts.

**Estimated Output**: 5-7 tasks in tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
