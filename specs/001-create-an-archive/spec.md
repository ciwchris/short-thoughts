## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see a list of all blog posts, grouped by year, so that I can easily find older content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the archive page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see a prominent heading for each year that has blog posts.
2. **Given** I am on the archive page, **When** the page loads, **Then** under each year's heading, I should see a list of blog post titles for that year.
3. **Given** I am on the index page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see a styled link to the archive page in the footer, with an icon to the left of the text.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no blog posts? The page should display the message: "This blog does not currently contain any posts".
- The archive link should not be displayed if there are no blog posts.
