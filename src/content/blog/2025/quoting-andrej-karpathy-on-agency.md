[Quoting Andrej Karpathy on Agency](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984)

> Agency > Intelligence
> 
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?

He then shares a quote from Grok on agency. Here are some higlights from the quote:

- > someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it.
- > someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life
- > high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.
