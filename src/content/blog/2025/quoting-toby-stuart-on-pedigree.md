Quoting Toby Stuart on the EconTalk episode [The Invisible Hierarchies that Rule Our World
](https://www.econtalk.org/the-invisible-hierarchies-that-rule-our-world-with-toby-stuart/)

The episode ended with a discussion on the impact of AI as it relates to people's status, that it
will reinforce the prestige hierarchy.

> When you can't judge quality that's precisely the time in which you rely on pedigree. 

He goes on to say:

Writing has been used just about everywhere to evaluate people. Now the capability of crafting
well written content is available to everyone. Consequently, we become more reliant on other
indicators for evaluation, which, unfortunately, are often characteristics over which people have
limited control

This line of thought presents a sobering reality. What was once seen as an equalizer for those
lacking inherited advantages potentially turns out to be detrimental to their advancement.
