This perfectly describes me, and probably a lot of other people too. When I appear "quicker" it's
because I've already had the conversation in my head many times, and covering many possible
directions. I call it "pre-thoughts".

My theory is because I am an introvert, both the characteristic of slow thinking as well as spending
a lot of time in thought beforehand.
