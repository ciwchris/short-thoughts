    People characterize the other person's story as inaccurate, their own story as accurate. And
    then there's... no space for curiosity or connection. It's all rupture, no repair.

[Quoting Lori Gottlieb in conversation with Andrew Huberman in How to Find & Be a Great Romantic
Partner](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-find-be-a-great-romantic-partner-lori-gottlieb)

> Drama tends to be from all the assumptions. Like, I know that, my truth, is the right story...
You were wrong. And I think it's so interesting because people come to therapy with these faulty
narratives...

> We're all storytellers. We all try to make sense of something, and we all believe that our
story is the absolute accurate version of the story, and actually it's so funny when you see
couples and they experience the same experience, and they have wildly different versions. 

> And then there's some part where the Venn diagram overlaps, and then finally, they can see,
oh, that person's not a bad person they were coming at it because they, in their story, they believe
this. And that's so important. So drama happens when assumptions are made. People characterize the
other person's story as inaccurate, their own story as accurate. And then there's... no space for
curiosity or connection. It's all rupture, no repair.
