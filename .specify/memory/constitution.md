# short-thoughts Constitution

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Technology Stack
The project uses Astro and Tailwind CSS. No other libraries or frameworks should be introduced.

### Principle 2: Content Management
All blog content is created and managed as Markdown files in the `src/content/blog` directory.

### Principle 3: Styling
All styling must be done using Tailwind CSS. Global styles are defined in `src/styles/global.css`, but should be used sparingly.

## Governance

This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development must adhere to it. Amendments require a pull request and approval from the project owner.
