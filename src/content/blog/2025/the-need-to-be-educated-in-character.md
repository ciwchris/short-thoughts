Quoting Robert P. George from the Pursuit: The Foundersâ€™ Guide to Happiness in the episode [In Order
to Be
Happy](https://constitutioncenter.org/news-debate/podcasts/pursuit-the-founders-guide-to-happiness/in-order-to-be-happy).

> Madison also understood that structural constraints by themselves would be insufficient. If we are
> to be self-governing people, that is, if we're to be citizens of a republic, then we need to be
> citizens who are capable of self-control of self-mastery of holding in check, at least to some
> extent. Those powerful evil impulses in our nature, and that requires education.

> So, Madison famously
> said only a well-instructed people can be permanently a free people. That is only a well-educated
> people can only be a people fit for self-government. They needed to be educated in their character.
> Capable of distinguishing good from bad, right from wrong, just for unjust.
