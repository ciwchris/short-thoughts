    Have software developers become the new product managers, À la Office Space

A constant complaint I've heard from software developers is that there isn't a product owner. No one
is creating requirements, no one is curating the backlog. Instead the software delivery team attempts
to suss out how applications and platforms are to be built. Fair enough, it's not very efficient to
be given a high level description of something and then have to determine what it means.

I'm not going to analyze or offer my thoughts on this predicament, but I was reflecting on it while
considering my current software development workflow:

- Receive a high level feature request
- Use AI to create detailed requirements based on the request and the state of the current
  application
- Edit the generated requirements
- Provide the final version of the requirements to an AI agent to implement
- …

If the desires of software developers were fulfilled then pristine requirements would be created by
a product owner. Software developers would then hand off the requirements to an AI agent for
implementation, thus making software developers then new Tom, the product manager from Office Space.
