I'm not precisely concerned about this. I don't believe my thinking has declined since using these
tools. Maybe they have in some trivial ways. But I believe my thinking has become more active
as a result of these tools, because I am able to explore and ask questions, to investigate in ways I
either was not able to before, or at least not as easily.

My concern is that there will be a division between people on how they use these tools. One side's
thinking will decline, while the other side's thinking will be enhanced, which will lead to a
further imbalance in society. It appears the statistics he references support this, the declines he
reports are not coming from those who already reported as high.

The author later he answers the question about what kids should study:

While I do not entirely agree with his phrasing, or at least I am uncertain with how
he phrased it, I do believe being able to work with conflicting ideas is an important skill. Perhaps
if someone "enjoys" the dissonance they become energized and thrive in these situations. And so
maybe the language is not too strong. But at the minimum I have found being able to wrestle with
conflicting ideas to be an important life skill.
