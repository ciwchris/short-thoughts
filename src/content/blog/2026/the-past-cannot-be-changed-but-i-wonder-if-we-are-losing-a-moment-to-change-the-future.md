  The past cannot be changed, but we are entering a unique moment with Artificial Intelligence that
  could either bridge historical gaps or widen them. Looking back at how exclusion from the
  Industrial Revolution and cheap land created a lasting divide, I wonder if we are losing a moment
  to change the future.

This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I found myself reflecting on the immense gap of privilege created
during the era of American slavery. Slavery existed globally, but its impact on Black Americans was
uniquely devastating. While there are more reasons for this than I'm even aware of, two in
particular strike me presently. First, the Industrial Revolution generated tremendous prosperity
that Black Americans were excluded from. Second, they were unable to participate in the opportunity
of cheap, claimable land.

My own family’s history benefited from this land. My great-grandfather arrived in the Pacific
Northwest and purchased farmland. He established a family farming corporation that accumulated
numerous plots of land which our family still owns today. As the last of the family farmers prepares
to retire, that land will be sold, resulting in a substantial profit.

These historical factors placed one group of Americans at an incredible advantage while another was
fighting for the basic rights promised, but not yet bestowed, by the U.S. Constitution. By the
time the Civil Rights movement secured these rights, the economic damage was already deep-seated.

Artificial Intelligence represents a unique moment in our history. It holds the potential to bridge
this gap. However, I fear the opposite will occur. I fear that AI will not decrease the gap, but
rather widen it until it becomes insurmountable.

With hindsight, we look back at the past with shame, wishing we could change what transpired. We
cannot change the past. But I wonder if we are currently overlooking a crucial moment to change the
future, or if we will repeat the sins of our fathers?
