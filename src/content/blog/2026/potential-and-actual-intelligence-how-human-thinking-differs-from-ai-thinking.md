  and actual intelligence informs a comparison of human and AI thinking.

After listening to the EconTalk podcast episode [Nature, Nurture, and Identical Twins (with David
Bessis)](https://www.econtalk.org/nature-nurture-and-identical-twins-with-david-bessis/), I read the
essay David Bessis wrote, [Twins reared apart do not
exist](https://davidbessis.substack.com/p/twins-reared-apart-do-not-exist), which was the subject of
the episode. Both were informative and helped me understand the conversation between hereditarians
and blank‑slatists. But something else caught my attention in the essay.

Bessis begins with three illustrations of potential values for the heritability of IQ, 30%, 50%, and
80%. He maps genetic potential against actual IQ for each percentage. In this post I'm not addressing
questions about IQ, its measurement, or use. What sparked my interest is the distinction between
potential and actual, and whether that distinction adds to the conversation on what differentiates
human thinking from AI thinking.

It seems to me that genetics does set limits on the range of capacity each human is able to achieve
in thinking, but it is not a predetermined number. Other factors have significant influence on
where each human ends up in this range. Therefore, there is some capacity the
individual human can achieve, but there is also some measured value designating where they currently
are.

This leads me to believe that there are many factors that influence how the brain thinks. It's not
about crunching data about a question and ending up at a result. Instead there's a lot of seemingly
unrelated data accumulated over a lifetime of experiences which mingle in the brain,
impacting pathways on the way to producing the thought.

How does AI compare when mapping genetic potential and actual IQ to machines? Is it accurate to say
that their training is their genetic potential and then reinforcement learning is their actual
potential? I don't think it is. In humans their actual potential continues to be shaped from their
interactions in the world. The experiences humans have influence us. For AI, once the model is
released it is fixed. Additional information can be provided to them which influences their
generated responses, but their intelligence is locked-in; their genetic potential is still
their actual intelligence.

In the end an AI’s intelligence is hereditary rather than blank‑slate, and that leads to a very
different form of thinking. AI thinking is not human thinking.
