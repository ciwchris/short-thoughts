Quoting Robert Greiner from [Believe the Checkbook: AI companies talk as if engineering is over.
Their acquisitions say the opposite.](https://robertgreiner.com/believe-the-checkbook/)

> The key constraint is obvious once you say it out loud. The bottleneck isn't code production, it

Regarding Athropic's language used in acquiring Bun:

> That’s investor-speak for: we're paying for how these people think, what they choose not to build,
> which tradeoffs they make under pressure. They didn't buy a pile of code. They bought a track
> record of correct calls in a complex, fast-moving domain.
