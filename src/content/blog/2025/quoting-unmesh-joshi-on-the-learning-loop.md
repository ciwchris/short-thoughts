Relatedly, on the topic of learning, I was pondering today how popular AI chat apps are great at
providing answers, but that is often opposed to learning.

This brings to mind the concept of designing a system so that users fall into the pit of success,
instead of the pit of despair. When using the popular AI chat systems for learning they are designed
so that by default users fall into the pit of despair, they are detrimental to learning. But it does
not need to be that way. Chat systems can be designed so that users fall into the pit of success, so
that by default they enrich the learning process.
